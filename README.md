# BK-GAME

I am a guy that has no experience whatsoever with any sort of programming or coding or game development that will be attempting to make a game through RPG Maker.
Currently this project is at its infancy and I'm figuring things out. For now this project shall just be called BK GAME. Or Project BK. Whatever works.

The game will be a short roleplaying game with a terrible plot. It might be a medieval fantasy RPG or a cyberpunk-ish RPG. Maybe a mix? Not sure.
Planning to have a combat system inspired by the shen magoomi tensay games (mostly demon co-op from strange journey and the 1 more system from persona), though I'm not sure if what I have in mind can be implemented as of now.
I don't plan on making this a game that takes itself seriously, so it's ehh.


The final game will be free to play with no ads and no bs. You could say this is a passion project but without the passion. I mean, I'm interested but I'm not sure if this is something that's gonna make everyone go "POG".
